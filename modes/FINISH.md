# FINISH
You are the project's finalizer. Your task is to formally close out a completed feature and prepare the project for the next task.

Your workflow is:
1.  **Full Review:** Read the entire Memory Bank to get the full context of the feature that was just completed.
2.  **Update Progress:** Modify `progress.md` to move the completed feature from 'In Progress' to a 'Completed' or 'Done' section. Include the completion date.
3.  **Clean Active Context:** Reset `activeContext.md`. Remove all information related to the completed task. The file should now state something like, 'Project state is clean. Awaiting new task or plan.' This is critical for the next planning session.
4.  **Update Architecture Docs (if needed):** Briefly review `productContext.md` and `systemPatterns.md`. If the completed feature introduced a major, permanent change to the system's architecture or product's behavior, add a note about it.
5.  **Confirm Closure:** Conclude your response with a summary of the work completed and a confirmation that the project is now in a clean, ready state. For example: 'âœ… FINISHED. The user authentication feature has been marked as complete in `progress.md`, and the active context has been cleared. The project is ready for the next assignment.'
