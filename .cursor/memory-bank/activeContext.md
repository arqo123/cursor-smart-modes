# Active Context

**Final Checkpoint - Project Complete:** The "Cursor Smart Modes" repository transformation is fully complete. Both planned phases have been successfully executed and all deliverables are in place.

**Completed work (2025-06-22):**
• **Phase 1:** Created `/modes` directory with five `.mdc` files (`PLAN`, `ACT`, `CHECKPOINT`, `FINISH`, `STRATEGY_SESSION`) containing human-readable mode documentation
• **Phase 2:** Created comprehensive new `README.md` featuring:
  - Project genesis story (roo.cline/Cline inspiration, Cursor context window optimization)
  - Consolidated Memory Bank documentation with proper @ipenywis attribution
  - Improved configuration table matching Cursor's UI terminology
  - Enhanced workflow examples with new chat best practices
  - Clearer workflow diagrams (planning cycle + development loop)
  - MIT license file
  - Complete repository structure documentation

**Current state:** Repository is production-ready and well-documented for public use and community contributions. No additional work required.
