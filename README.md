 # Cursor Smart Modes

[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)

A comprehensive framework for AI-driven development using Cursor's custom modes. This system transforms Cursor from a simple code generator into a true development partner capable of managing complex, multi-phase projects with persistent memory and structured workflows.

## üéØ Genesis

This project was born from practical experience with various AI development tools. After working with solutions like roo.cline and Cline, I was inspired to create a similar workflow system for Cursor. 

The challenge with Cursor's cost-effective approach is how it handles context window compression and truncation. This often leads to degraded results when working on larger tasks. The solution? A phased development approach that operates on smaller code sections while maintaining detailed, step-by-step planning. This approach results in:

- **Reduced context window usage** = Less compression = Better results
- **Persistent project memory** across sessions
- **Structured, manageable development phases**

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Memory Bank Initialization

Copy the content from [`memory-bank.md`](./memory-bank.md) and follow these steps:

1. **Add to Cursor User Rules**: Go to Cursor Settings ‚Üí Rules ‚Üí User Rules and paste the entire content of the `memory-bank.md` file
2. **Initialize via AGENT mode**: In any Cursor chat, switch to AGENT mode and type "initialize memory bank"

Memory bank initialization happens automatically when you type 'initialize memory bank' in AGENT mode, provided the memory-bank.md content has already been added to User Rules.

### 2. Setup Custom Modes

1. Review the individual mode files in [`/modes/`](./modes/) for detailed explanations
2. Configure Cursor according to the [Configuration Table](#configuration-table) below

### 3. Start Using Modes

In any Cursor chat, simply type:
- `@PLAN` - Plan a new feature or task
- `@ACT` - Execute a single phase of work  
- `@CHECKPOINT` - Save current state
- `@FINISH` - Close out completed work
- `@ARCHITECT` - Deep planning for complex features

## üìñ Real-Life Usage Scenarios

Here are practical examples showing how developers use the smart modes system in real projects:

### Scenario 1: Building a Complete Feature (Large Task)

**The Request:** "Build an analytics dashboard for our e-commerce app"

```
Developer: @PLAN Build an analytics dashboard for our e-commerce app.

Cursor (PLAN): I need to understand this better. Let me ask some questions:
1. What specific metrics do you want to track? (sales, user behavior, etc.)
2. What's your current tech stack?
3. Do you need real-time data or daily reports?
4. Who will be the primary users of this dashboard?
5. Any existing analytics tools we need to integrate with?
6. What's your timeline and priority level?

[After Q&A session...]

Here's my 4-phase implementation plan:
- Phase 1: Database schema and data collection endpoints
- Phase 2: Analytics processing service 
- Phase 3: Dashboard UI components
- Phase 4: Integration and testing

This is a multi-phase task. I've saved the plan in CHECKPOINT. To ensure clean context, please open a new chat and run @ACT to begin Phase 1.

Developer: (Opens new chat) @ACT

Cursor (ACT): Reading Memory Bank... Starting Phase 1: Database schema and data collection.
[Implements database migrations, API endpoints, data models...]
Phase 1 complete and documented. To safely save this progress, please run @CHECKPOINT.

Developer: @CHECKPOINT

Cursor (CHECKPOINT): ‚úÖ CHECKPOINT CREATED
Phase 1 progress saved to Memory Bank. Ready for Phase 2.

Developer: (Opens new chat) @ACT

Cursor (ACT): Reading Memory Bank... Starting Phase 2: Analytics processing service.
[Implements data aggregation, caching, scheduled jobs...]
Phase 2 complete. Please run @CHECKPOINT.

[Process continues through all phases...]

Developer: @FINISH

Cursor (FINISH): ‚úÖ PROJECT COMPLETED
Analytics dashboard marked as finished. All phases documented in progress.md.
Memory Bank reset for next assignment.
```

### Scenario 2: Quick Enhancement (Small Task)

**The Request:** "Add loading states and error handling to the contact form"

```
Developer: @PLAN Add loading states and error handling to our contact form

Cursor (PLAN): I've analyzed your contact form in `components/ContactForm.tsx`. I can see it's missing:
1. Loading spinner during form submission
2. Error handling for failed submissions  
3. Success message after successful submission
4. Form validation feedback

This is a straightforward enhancement that can be completed in one phase. The form already has basic structure and API integration. Should I proceed with @ACT in this same chat?

Developer: Yes, go ahead.

Cursor (ACT): Implementing form enhancements...
[Updates ContactForm.tsx with loading states, error handling, success messages]
[Adds form validation with user feedback]
[Updates CSS for loading spinner and message styling]
[Tests form behavior with success/error scenarios]

Enhanced contact form with:
‚úÖ Loading spinner during submission
‚úÖ Error handling with user-friendly messages
‚úÖ Success confirmation message
‚úÖ Real-time validation feedback
‚úÖ Proper form state management

Developer: @FINISH

Cursor (FINISH): ‚úÖ TASK COMPLETED
Contact form enhancements documented in progress.md. Form now provides proper user feedback for all interaction states.
```

### Scenario 3: Complex Architecture Planning (Architect Session)

**The Request:** "We need to redesign our user authentication system for better security"

```
Developer: @ARCHITECT Redesign our authentication system for better security

Cursor (ARCHITECT): This is a critical system change. Let me conduct a thorough analysis:

1. Current authentication method? (JWT, sessions, OAuth?)
2. What security concerns are you addressing?
3. Do you need to maintain backward compatibility?
4. Are you considering multi-factor authentication?
5. What's your user base size?
6. Any compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)?
7. Timeline constraints?
8. Do you want to use third-party auth providers?

[Extended Q&A session...]

Based on our discussion, here's the comprehensive approach:

**SECURITY AUDIT PHASE**
- Review current vulnerabilities
- Analyze session management
- Check password policies

**DESIGN PHASE** 
- JWT ‚Üí OAuth 2.0 + PKCE migration
- Multi-factor authentication integration
- Session management overhaul

**IMPLEMENTATION PHASES**
- Phase 1: New auth service architecture
- Phase 2: Database schema migration
- Phase 3: Frontend auth flow redesign
- Phase 4: MFA implementation
- Phase 5: Migration plan for existing users
- Phase 6: Testing and security audit

I've created a detailed plan directory with implementation specifics for each phase.
This is a 6-phase project. Ready to start with @PLAN for Phase 1?

Developer: Perfect. Let's begin.
[Opens new chat] @PLAN Start Phase 1 of the authentication redesign.

[Development continues through structured phases...]
```

### üéØ PLAN vs ARCHITECT: When to Use Which?

Understanding when to use **@PLAN** versus **@ARCHITECT** is crucial for optimal workflow:

| Aspect | **@PLAN Mode** | **@ARCHITECT Mode** |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Purpose** | Feature implementation planning | System architecture & design decisions |
| **Scope** | Single feature or task | Multiple interconnected systems |
| **Duration** | 10-30 minutes | 1-3 hours |
| **Q&A Depth** | 4-6 focused questions | 15-25 comprehensive questions |
| **Output** | Implementation phases | Detailed system design + implementation phases |
| **When to Use** | "Add user profiles", "Build search feature" | "Redesign authentication", "Scale database architecture" |
| **Best For** | Ready-to-implement features | Features requiring architectural decisions |

**Examples:**
- **Use @PLAN**: Adding a contact form, implementing dark mode, fixing performance issues
- **Use @ARCHITECT**: Microservices migration, security overhaul, multi-tenant architecture

These scenarios demonstrate how the smart modes adapt to different project scales - from simple fixes to complex architectural changes - while maintaining context and ensuring nothing gets lost between sessions.

## üß† Memory Bank System

> **Note:** The Memory Bank concept originates from [this excellent gist](https://gist.github.com/ipenywis/1bdb541c3a612dbac4a14e1e3f4341ab) by @ipenywis.

The Memory Bank is Cursor's persistent memory system - a collection of Markdown files that maintain project context across sessions. Since AI memory resets between sessions, this documentation becomes the project's "second brain."

### Memory Bank Structure

    PC --> AC[activeContext.md]
    SP --> AC
    TC --> AC
    
    AC --> P[progress.md]
```

### Core Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `projectbrief.md` | Foundation document defining core requirements and project scope |
| `productContext.md` | Why the project exists, problems it solves, user experience goals |
| `activeContext.md` | Current work focus, recent changes, next steps |
| `systemPatterns.md` | System architecture, technical decisions, design patterns |
| `techContext.md` | Technologies used, development setup, constraints |
| `progress.md` | What works, what's left to build, current status, known issues |

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Modes

Our workflow uses five specialized modes, each with a specific role:

### PLAN Mode
**Goal:** Transform user requests into structured, multi-phase implementation plans
- Conducts Q&A sessions to clarify requirements
- Breaks down complex tasks into manageable phases
- Automatically creates checkpoints for multi-phase plans

### ACT Mode  
**Goal:** Execute a single phase of an existing plan
- Reads Memory Bank to understand current context
- Implements ONLY the current phase
- Documents work and proposes checkpoint

### CHECKPOINT Mode
**Goal:** Save current project state to Memory Bank
- Creates a "save game" state of all progress
- Updates `activeContext.md` and `progress.md`
- Ensures seamless continuation in future sessions

### FINISH Mode
**Goal:** Formally close out completed features
- Archives completed work in `progress.md`
- Resets `activeContext.md` for new tasks
- Confirms project is ready for next assignment

### ARCHITECT Mode
**Goal:** Deep-dive planning for large, complex features
- Extended interactive discovery sessions
- Generates detailed multi-file implementation plans
- Creates structured plan directories for maximum clarity

## üìã Configuration Table

Configure each mode in Cursor's settings as follows:

| Mode | Recommended Model | Enable in Cursor | Disable in Cursor |
|------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **üìã PLAN** | GPT-o3, Claude 4 Thinking, Gemini 2.5 Pro | ‚úÖ **Search**<br>‚úÖ **Read file, Fetch rules** | ‚ùå **Edit**<br>‚ùå **Run**<br>‚ùå **MCP** (servers) |
| **‚ö° ACT** | Claude 4, GPT-4.1 | ‚úÖ **Search**<br>‚úÖ **Edit**<br>‚úÖ **Run** | ‚ùî **MCP** (only if needed) |
| **üíæ CHECKPOINT** | Auto / Claude 4, GPT-4.1 | ‚úÖ **Read file, Fetch rules**<br>‚úÖ **Edit** | ‚ùå **Run**<br>‚ùå **MCP** (servers)<br>‚ùå **Web, Codebase** |
| **‚úÖ FINISH** | Auto / Claude 4, GPT-4.1 | ‚úÖ **Read file, List directory, Search files, Grep**<br>‚úÖ **Edit & Reapply** | ‚ùå **Delete file**<br>‚ùå **Run**<br>‚ùå **MCP** (servers)<br>‚ùå **Codebase, Web** |
| **üß† ARCHITECT** | GPT-o3, Claude 4 Thinking, Gemini 2.5 Pro | ‚úÖ **Search**<br>‚úÖ **Edit** | ‚ùå **Run** |

### Detailed Tool Configuration

**üìã PLAN Mode** - Deep analysis without making changes:
- **‚úÖ Search Category**: Codebase analysis, Web research, Grep/Search files for dependencies, List directory for structure navigation, Read file for Memory Bank and code analysis, Fetch rules for understanding existing patterns
- **‚ùå Edit Category**: Prevention against accidental modifications during planning phase
- **‚ùå Run Category**: No terminal commands needed for planning
- **‚ùå MCP**: Not relevant for planning phase

**‚ö° ACT Mode** - Full implementation capabilities:
- **‚úÖ Search Category**: Continued need for reading files, finding definitions, and web research during implementation
- **‚úÖ Edit Category**: Core functionality for writing and modifying code
- **‚úÖ Run Category**: Essential for testing, installing dependencies, compilation, and running development servers
- **‚ùî MCP**: Enable only if your project requires server operations

**üíæ CHECKPOINT Mode** - Focused state saving:
- **‚úÖ Limited Search**: Only Read file and Fetch rules needed for reviewing files to update
- **‚úÖ Edit Category**: Essential for updating Memory Bank files (.md and .cursorrules)
- **‚ùå Run Category**: State saving doesn't require terminal operations
- **‚ùå Web/Codebase**: Not needed for summarization tasks

**‚úÖ FINISH Mode** - Clean Memory Bank operations:
- **‚úÖ Selective Search**: Read file (essential), List directory/Search files/Grep (helpful for locating files), but exclude Codebase/Web (work is already complete)
- **‚úÖ Edit & Reapply**: Critical for updating progress.md and activeContext.md
- **‚ùå Delete file**: Safety measure against accidental file deletion
- **‚ùå Run Category**: Finalization doesn't require terminal commands

**üß† ARCHITECT Mode** - Comprehensive planning:
- **‚úÖ Search Category**: Essential for Q&A phase and thorough analysis
- **‚úÖ Edit Category**: Required for generating detailed implementation plans
- **‚ùå Run Category**: Planning doesn't require terminal operations

## üåä Workflow Examples

### Large Task (Multi-Phase)
```
@PLAN ‚Üí [New Chat] @ACT ‚Üí @CHECKPOINT ‚Üí [New Chat] @ACT ‚Üí ... ‚Üí @FINISH
```

**Key Points:**
- Always start new chats for each ACT phase to maintain clean context
- CHECKPOINT can be run in the same chat immediately after ACT
- Important information persists in Memory Bank between sessions

### Medium Task  
```
@PLAN ‚Üí [New Chat] @ACT ‚Üí @FINISH
```
For tasks needing formal planning but executable in one phase.

### Small Task
```
@PLAN ‚Üí @ACT
```
For simple tasks where PLAN determines no checkpoint needed.

### Important: New Chat Best Practices

üîÑ **Always start a new chat when:**
- Beginning a new ACT phase
- Moving between major workflow steps

‚úÖ **Same chat is OK for:**
- Running CHECKPOINT immediately after ACT
- Quick clarifications within the same phase

This ensures the Memory Bank maintains state while keeping each execution context clean and focused.

## üè¢ Multi-Repository Support

When working with VS Code Workspaces containing multiple repositories:

1. **Each repository needs its own Memory Bank** (`.cursor/memory-bank/`)
2. **Specify context in prompts:** `@PLAN Context: @my-api-repo. Add user authentication.`
3. **AI focuses exclusively** on the specified repository's Memory Bank

```mermaid
